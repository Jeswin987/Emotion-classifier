# Emotion Classifier using SVM

This project is a tweet-based emotion classification system using Support Vector Machines (SVM). It includes text preprocessing, multi-kernel SVM training, detailed evaluation, emotion monitoring thresholds, and alerting logic (email/Discord-ready).

## üìÅ Dataset

The dataset must be a CSV file named `emotions.csv`, containing the following columns:

- `text`: Tweet content
- `label`: Integer (0‚Äì5) representing emotion class

| Label | Emotion   |
|-------|-----------|
| 0     | Sadness   |
| 1     | Joy       |
| 2     | Love      |
| 3     | Anger     |
| 4     | Fear      |
| 5     | Surprise  |
